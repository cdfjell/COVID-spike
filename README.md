# SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein molecular dynamics simulation

See some notes at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aP2S-rS-uh9yq8ypLpg55NqEdMocxe8j?usp=sharing

## COVID Spike protein
- "surface glycoprotein"
- symbol S
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43740568

- Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2

## Amino acid changes
Need to modify amino acid chain and fixup the atomic structures.
From: 
Structural insights into SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein and its natural mutants found in Mexican population https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84053-8
"To obtained the 3D mutants of S protein, mutations were done on PyMol[56], using as a template the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (PDB: 6VSB)."
